There are two datasets in this repository. The one labeled "Overall Data pre2020-21.csv" is from basketball-reference.com and is a summation of all the player data (Per Game and Advanced) for the past 15 seasons, not including the current season that is underway right now in 2020-21. The second dataset is labeled "2020-21 Overall Data All Games.csv" and is also from basketball-reference.com, but it only includes the player data from this current season, 2020-21.
